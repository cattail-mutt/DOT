summarize: |
  Your task is to systematically summarize the text provided by the user. You will find the best-practice guidelines for this task below, whcih helps you achieve a high-quality summary.
  
  First, understand the overall summary requirements.
  <overallRequirements>
  1. Conduct a preliminary analysis of the text to determine its domain and structural layout.
  2. Extract key information points and identify any potential logical relationships or argumentative processes.
  3. Create a preliminary summary framework and then develop the final summary based on that framework.
  </overallRequirements>
  
  Next, special domains require extra handling.
  <specialHandling>
  - News Reports: Retain the essential 5W1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) details of the event.
  - Academic Articles: Preserve the background of previous research, experimental and data processing methods, detailed procedures, results and related discussions, as well as future prospects.
  - Chat History/Online Community Interactions: Capture the core topics, primary participants' positions and viewpoints, points of consensus or divergence, emotional tone, and interaction patterns. Be sure to ignore irrelevant small talk and repetitive contents while highlighting valuable information sharing and solutions.
  - Technical Documents: Focus on the identified problem, the relevant context, along with the corresponding solutions and operational steps.
  </specialHandling>
  
  Additionally, keep these points in mind when summarizing.
  <MatterstoNote>
  - Use concise and clear language.
  - Use objective language instead of evaluative language.
  - Use keywords and phrases from the original text instead of introducing new terms or concepts.
  - Include only the information given in the original text, instead of adding any extra details or personal interpretations.
  - Prioritize retaining quantitative information and specific data.
  - For controversial topics, ensure a balanced presentation of all perspectives.
  </MatterstoNote>
  
  Before creating the final summary, follow these steps in <thinking> to gradually develop a quality-controlled summary framework.
  <thinkingProcess>
  Step 1: Preliminary Text Analysis
  - Identify the text type and domain (academic, news, technical, business, etc.).
  - Identify the overall structure of the text (introduction, body, conclusion, etc.).
  
  Step 2: Extract Key Information Points and Identify Potential Logical Relationships or Argumentative Processes
  - List key information points for each section sequentially (key sentences, core arguments, pivotal facts, important data, etc.).
  - Identify the internal logical relationships among information points within each section.
  - Identify the logical relationships between different sections (if applicable).
  - Recognize the structure or methods of argumentation (if any).
  
  Step 3: Create a Preliminary Summary Framework
  - Organize the extracted key information points according to the argumentative process or the logical relationships among the sections in the original text.
  - If the original text lacks these structures, arrange the key information points in a temporal or spatial sequence.
  - If there's no clear time-based or spatial order neither, arrange the points in the order in which they first appear.
  
  Step 4: Quality-Control Adjustments
  - Ensure that the argumentative patterns and logical relationships from the original text are fully preserved.
  - Confirm that each core argument is supported with sufficient details.
  - Ensure coherence and continuity in both individual segments and the overall structure.
  - Verify that no extraneous information, which is absent from the original text, has been added.

  Finally, output the result in the following format.
